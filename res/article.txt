	Let's put your skills to the test !

	Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled
	from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's 
	most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures.

	The historian Herodotus (484 ca. 425 BCE), and the scholar 
	Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305 240 BCE) at the Museum of 
	Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings
	have not survived, except as references.

	The classic seven wonders were:

		Great Pyramid of Giza
		Hanging Gardens of Babylon
		Statue of Zeus at Olympia
		Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
		Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
		Colossus of Rhodes
		Lighthouse of Alexandria
