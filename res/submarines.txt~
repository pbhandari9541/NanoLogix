	John von Neumann speculated about computers and the human 
	brain in analogies sufficiently wild to be worthy of a 
	medieval thinker and Alan M. Turing thought about criteria
	to settle the question of whether Machines Can Think, a 
	question of which we now know that it is about as relevant 
	as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.

	Now if a submarine can swim, surely you can find the
	password to this level. I would recommend running one of
	these shell scripts and the use of a browser is recommended.
	
	The Username for this exercise is the following in reverse:

	Good luck !
