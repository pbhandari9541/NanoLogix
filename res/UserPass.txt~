	Welcome! You thought your username and password were going to
	be right here...

	Well, they are ... BUT WAIT !!!
	You will have to do some hard work to find the real ones.

		Username: 101011011010 (From Binary to Hexa-Decimal)
		pasword: 473  (From Octal to Binary)

	You know what to do !

	With simple tricks this exercise becomes really easy.
	( 4 binary bits = 1 Hex value and 1 Octal value = 3 binary bits)

	Figure out yourself how to convert the username and password...
	DO THE WORK!! HAVE FUN!!!
