	If we think of consciousness as the state of awareness, or, of being
	aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been
	defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience
	or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive 
	control system of the mind.

	Now, why do so many consider artificial consciousness impossible? 
	Neuroscience hypothesizes that consciousness is generated by the 
	interoperation of various parts of the brain, called the neural 
	correlates of consciousness or NCC, though there are challenges to
	that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct
	machines that can emulate this NCC interoperation.

	Can you imagine a computer that is self aware? The possibilities are 
	limitless! A computer that can learn on it's own and constantly rewrite
	it's code would far surpass human capabilities.

	The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to "define that 
	which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in
	an engineered artifact"

	Here's something to ponder about...
