	I am currently working on an an abstract machine that manipulates
	symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules; actually,
	to be more exact, it is more like a mathematical model that defines
	such a machine.
 
	Just imagine, an unlimited memory capacity obtained in the form of 
	an infinite tape marked out into squares, on each of which a symbol
	could be printed. At any moment there is one symbol in the machine;
	it is called the scanned symbol.

	The machine can alter the scanned symbol, and its behavior is in part
	determined by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do 
	not affect the behavior of the machine. However, the tape can be moved
	back and forth through the machine, this being one of the elementary 
	operations of the machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore 
	eventually have an innings. This is the beginning of a new Era.

	If you want to know more about this revolutionary machine. 
	Try connecting on my account.
