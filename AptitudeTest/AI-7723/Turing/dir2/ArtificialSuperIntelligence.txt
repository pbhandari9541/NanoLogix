	There's a saying among futurists that a human-equivalent artificial 
	intelligence will be our last invention. After that, AIs will be capable
	of designing virtually anything on their own â€” including themselves. 
	Here's how a recursively self-improving AI could transform itself into 
	a superintelligent machine.

	When it comes to understanding the potential for artificial intelligence,
	it's critical to understand that an AI might eventually be able to modify
	itself, and that these modifications could allow it to increase its intelligence
	extremely fast.

	Code that's capable of altering its own instructions while it's still executing
	has been around for a while. Typically, it's done to reduce the instruction path
	length and improve performance, or to simply reduce repetitively similar code. 
	But for all intents and purposes, there are no self-aware, self-improving AI 
	systems today.

	In fact, we do have software that can write software.

	Genetic programming is a machine-learning technique that harnesses the power of 
	natural selection to find answers to problems it would take humans a long time, 
	even years, to solve, It's also used to write innovative, high-powered software.
