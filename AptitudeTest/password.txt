	Greetings AI-9340,

	I have sent confidential files to your direction for your initialization
	protocol. All files are encrypted, you will need to login to my account 
	to be able to decrypt them. For security I will give you my password as
	a riddle:

	I never was, am always to be, No one ever saw me, nor ever will, And yet 
	I am the confidence of all, To live and to breathe on this terrestrial 
	ball. What am I?

	Don't forget to login with my username, good luck !
